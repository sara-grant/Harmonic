            for this week, i wanted to create a ring rotation based around a theme. the theme i landed on was 'animals.' there is no one reason i felt compelled to choose this for my theme - i just miss being surrounded by more animals. minus the subway rats and occasional pigeon, i have had little to no interaction with animals/bugs/etc. back in florida, where i'm from, i would see iguanas, squirrels, geckos, frogs, toads, and many more little critters on the daily. even though this is my second year living in nyc, i still get a little homesick from time to time.
