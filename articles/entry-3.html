            this week i want to focus on a specific ring. as seen on my left index finger, i decided to wear my 'frog playing kazoo' ring. although an extremely goofy ring, this ring carries importance - it was the first ever ring i bought. a little under a year ago, i was wandering around the union square holiday market and stumbled upon a small booth owned by a lady wearing the most outragious earings i had ever seen - it was iconic! her store inventory consisted of wacky earings that were made from strange trinkets ands rings in all shapes and sizes. my friend pointed out this frog ring to me and i tried it on for fun; i didn't expect to actually like it! something about the personality of the ring - and shop owner - was extremely charming to me. safe to say, i will definitely be on the lookout for this booth at this years holiday market!
