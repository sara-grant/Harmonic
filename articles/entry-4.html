            this week i chose to stick to an overarching theme. i wanted to wear rings that i had bought at times in which i was surrounded by my friends. all five of these rings have their own sentimental value to me due to the people i was around at the time of purchasing them. infact, the spider ring on my right ring finger is one of two matching rings i share with a close friend of mine!
