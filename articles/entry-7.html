            for this week i chose to wear all of the rings given to me by my mother. later this week, she's flying to nyc to come visit me so i thought i would dedicate this entry to her. similarly to how my grandmother did, my mom wears a lot of fun and unique jewelry collected from all around the world. funnily enough, the square skull ring that i wear almost every day is from greenwich village - not too far from where i am right now.
