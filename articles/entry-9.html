            this week i have no rings to show. i was able to go back to florida for a few days to visit home and didn't want to risk losing any of my rings in transit. it was really nice to get away from the city for a bit, as much as i love it here. the weather was really nice too. but my favorite part about going home is seeing my old bedroom. i'm sure i'm not the only one who feels this way; it's only natural to want to cherish that feeling of nostalgia you're hit with the instant you step foot into your childhood bedroom.
