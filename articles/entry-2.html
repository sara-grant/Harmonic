            this week i stayed within my comfort zone. i often wear my square skull, watch, and braided ring daily. besides those, i want to focus on the crown pinky ring. this is pretty much the first time i’ve worn this ring since i got it last weekend, other than the day i bought it. this crown ring is actually the only pinky ring i have in my collection, which is why i wanted to talk about it this week. i bought it while i was at the new york renaissance fair at one of the local artist’s booths. not only was i attracted to the crown itself, but i thought buying a size to fit my pinky finger would add more personality to the ring. the irony of my pinky finger – the smallest finger – wearing a crown was a little bit funny to me. i also wanted to support a local artist!
