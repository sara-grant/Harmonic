    this week i am debuting two new rings! back in <a href="entry-3.html" class="links">entry 3,</a> i mentioned how i got my first ever ring from the union square holiday market. well, my two new rings, the triple ring and greek meander, are from the exact same vender i bought from last year! funnily enough, while i was looking through the rings that were being sold at her booth this year, another woman came up and mentioned that she had bought a ring from her last year - a "frog playing a kazoo" to be exact. i immediately chimed in and exclaimed that i had also bought that ring from her last year! i love my new rings and will most likely go back for more later this year due to how affordable they are!
