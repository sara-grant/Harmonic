            this week i hit a bit of a block. i haven't been wearing as many rings as of late due to having to take exams; i can't write very well while wearing big rings and usually end up taking them off temporarily. because of this, i decided to find all of my biggest, chunkiest rings and wear every single one of them - just for fun!
