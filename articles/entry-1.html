            this week's rotation consists soley of rings gifted to me by my grandmother. because she is a big part of why i started collecting fun rings, i thought it would be fitting to start with a rotation dedicated to her. when she was alive, she constantly inspired me with her quirky fashion tastes and obnoxious jewelry. although she isn't here to see how far i've come, these small silver pieces of her are.
